##Instructions for Pycharm
1. Clone.
1. git branch etc
1. Go to file -> New Project -> Create the project (from existing sources)
1. Exclude the "r" (recordings) directory 
1. in terminal: python3 ./mgz_aoc_clone/setup.py install (important to run this before requirements.txt because there is some dependency f*)
   OBS! mgz_aoc_clone in the repo is the one after setup.py has been run on it, so if there are any problems due to this a fresh clone may be needed. 
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
1. apart from requirements_txt, command line 'zip' and 'unzip' is used, so make sure those work.  
1. test running src/grabs.py (after setting the workspace to outer)
1. test running process_recordings.py 

## other
* make sure downloaded records are in gitignore!!! Repo is ruined if they're added.
